# NoFrustrationMagic Privacy Policy

Welcome to NoFrustrationMagic (the "Application"), developed by `Gustavo Vera` ("we", "us", "our"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect information in connection with our mobile application.

By downloading, accessing, or using our Application, you agree to the information collection and use practices described in this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect the following types of information:

   **a. Information Stored Locally on Your Device:**
    *   **Game State:** This includes your lives, land and spell counters, maximum lives, maximum land and spell settings, player name (if you set one), selected header background, and card draw history. This information is essential for the Application's functionality and is stored solely on your device using AsyncStorage. We do not transmit this information to our servers.
    *   **Premium Feature Status:** If you unlock premium features via a rewarded advertisement, we locally store an indicator of this unlocked status. This status resets according to the application's logic (e.g., when the game is reset).

   **b. Automatically Collected Information (via Advertising Partners):**
    We use Google AdMob to display advertisements in the free version of the Application. AdMob may collect information to provide personalized and non-personalized ads. This information may include:
    *   **Device Identifiers:** Such as Google Advertising ID (AAID) or Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA).
    *   **IP Address:** To estimate general geographic location.
    *   **Device Information:** Device model, operating system and version, mobile network information.
    *   **Ad Interactions:** Information about the ads shown to you and how you interact with them (e.g., views, clicks).
    *   **Application Usage Data (Aggregated and Anonymized):** Certain information about your activity within the Application may be collected by AdMob to improve its services.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

*   **To Provide and Maintain the Application:** To enable you to use the Application's features, such as tracking game state and draw history.
*   **To Store Your Progress and Preferences:** Locally stored information is used to save your current game state and preferences within the Application.
*   **To Display Advertisements:** In the free version of the Application, we use Google AdMob to display ads. This helps us keep the Application free. Ads may be personalized based on your interests (unless you have opted out of ad personalization) or non-personalized.
*   **To Offer Rewarded Features:** If you choose to watch a rewarded ad to temporarily unlock premium features, we use the confirmation of the ad view to activate those features.
*   **To Comply with Legal Obligations:** If required by law or in response to valid legal processes.

## 3. Sharing and Disclosure of Information

We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following circumstances:

*   **Advertising Partners:** We share information (primarily automatically collected information) with our advertising partner, Google AdMob, so they can display ads in the Application. Google AdMob uses this information in accordance with its own privacy policies. We recommend you review Google's privacy policy: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and how Google uses information from sites or apps that use its services: [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).
*   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if required to do so by law, court order, or other governmental or legal request, or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with laws and reasonable requests of law enforcement or to protect the security or integrity of our Service.
*   **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, sale of some or all of our assets or stock, financing, public offering, acquisition of all or a portion of our business, a similar transaction or proceeding, or steps in contemplation of such activities, some or all of the information described in this Privacy Policy may be shared or transferred, subject to standard confidentiality obligations.

## 4. Your Rights and Choices

*   **Control of Locally Stored Data:** You can manage locally stored game data by resetting the game within the Application's settings or by clearing the Application's data through your mobile device's settings. Uninstalling the Application will also delete all locally stored data.
*   **Opt-Out of Personalized Advertising:** You can opt out of personalized advertising from Google AdMob and other third-party advertisers by adjusting your mobile device settings:
    *   **For iOS:** Go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Advertising > and turn on "Limit Ad Tracking."
    *   **For Android:** Go to Settings > Google > Ads > and turn on "Opt out of Ads Personalization."
    Please note that you will still see ads, but they will not be based on your interests.
*   **Access to Your Data:** Most game-relevant information is stored locally on your device. For information collected by our advertising partners, please refer to their privacy policies for details on how to access your data.

## 5. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the information stored locally on your device and work with advertising partners like Google AdMob who have their own robust security measures to protect the information they collect. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Our Application is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In our ad settings, we have specified that the application should not be treated as child-directed and have set an appropriate ad content rating. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at `[Your Contact Email Address]`, and we will take steps to remove that information from our systems if applicable (primarily relevant for data that might be collected by third parties, as we do not store personal data on servers).

## 7. Third-Party Services

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to Google AdMob or any other third-party services you access through the Application. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services before providing them with personal information.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. If the changes are significant, we may provide a more prominent notice (such as an in-app notification).
